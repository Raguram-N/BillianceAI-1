# 🤖 BillianceAI — Felina
## An Interactive AI Assistant - Just feel what you hear

Transforming college enquiry calls into immersive visual experiences.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Most AI calling agents today sound the same — voice-only, repetitive, and robotic.  
But students making admission enquiries don’t just want information — they want **clarity, trust, and visual understanding**.

**BillianceAI introduces a breakthrough:**  
An AI admission agent (**Felina**) that doesn’t just talk — it also make you to **feel the conversation.**

Felina sends a beautifully designed *visual admission deck* to the student's WhatsApp and walks them through it slide-by-slide during the call.

> 🎯 Turning cold enquiry calls into warm, guided visual journeys.

## 💭 How the Idea Started

A normal call goes like this:


1. Student: “What’s the fee?”
Felina: “Bla bla bla…”



2. Student: “What about placements?”
Felina: “Bla bla bla…”



3. Student: “How is the campus?”
Felina: “Bla bla bla…”


After a few questions, the call becomes monotonous.  
The information is correct — but **the experience is boring**.

Students get influence not just by answers, but by **presentation**.

That sparked the idea:

> ❓ Why should our AI hide behind voice?  
> 💡 Why not make it **visually interactive**?

## Visual-Interactive AI Calling

**📽️ Felina - its time to influence**

- After endlessly replying
> **Felina:**  
> “Sir, I would like to walk you through the college visually. It takes just a few minutes sir!
> I’ve sent you a short brochure. Kindly open it, sir.” (Use earphones or phone speaker for better experince)

Student opens the PDF on WhatsApp.  
Felina becomes a **visual tour guide**.

Each page now becomes a talking point:
 
- Campus Photos  
- Departments & Facilities  
- Achievements   
- Placement Records 
- Fee Structure 
- Counselling Code  

This creates an **engaging, memorable, premium experience**.
